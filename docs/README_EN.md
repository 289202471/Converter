## 1. Abstract  
It is just an easy tool running on the terminal . Not a project , just two java files .   
If you really want , you can run them by the java cmd line without IDE .  
The main function of the tool is convert the case which copied by you .  
If you want to convert some word to upper case or lower case,Just use it !

Copy the word ! Select the word and "Ctrl + C".  
Run the tool , and then you will see .    
```
Please choose what you want to do:(1 or 2)
1.Upper
2.Lower
```  
Choose the one you need .  
Find somewhere you can edit text and "Ctrl + V" .   
eg:  
If you copy "System" and choose 1 , you will get "SYSTEM" .   
If you copy "System" and choose 2 , you will get "system" .   

## 3. Something About This Tool  
the number of line of the code is less than 300 , just read the source code to get something what you want .  
I think my code easy to read .
 
## 4. Disclaimer  
It is just a tiny tool that I need to finish my daily work , no security .  
If you copy some character which is not the letter , I don't know what's going to happen to .
